Distributed-Bellman-Ford
========================

This is a simple version of Distance Vector algorithm that can simulate real routing protocol to update forwarding table among different nodes, based on socket programming and multi-thread processing. It contains only one code script (DVclient.py) for testing. This script can be run on the same or different machine. The nodes will communicate with each other via UDP and updating their own DV tables
